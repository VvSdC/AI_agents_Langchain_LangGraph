The name \"over\" came about because the umpire calls \"Over!\" when six legal balls (deliveries) have been bowled. At this point, another bowler is deployed at the other end, and the fielding side changes ends while the batters do not. A bowler cannot bowl two successive overs, although a bowler can (and usually does) bowl alternate overs, from the same end, for several overs which are termed a \"spell\"; if the captain wants a bowler to \"change ends\", another bowler must temporarily fill in so that the change is not immediate. The batters do not change ends at the end of the over, and so the one who was non-striker is now the striker and vice versa. The umpires also change positions so that the one who was at \" \" now stands behind the wicket at the nonstriker\\'s end and vice versa.  \\n95  \\n[  \\n]  \\nsquare leg  \\n95  \\n[  \\n]  \\nFielding  \\nMain article:  \\nFielding (cricket)  \\nfor a right-handed batter  \\nFielding positions in cricket  \\nOf the eleven fielders, three are in shot in the image above.

Standardly, this involves adopting a slight crouch with the feet pointing across the front of the wicket, looking in the direction of the bowler, and holding the bat so it passes over the feet and so its tip can rest on the ground near to the toes of the back foot.  \\n98  \\n[  \\n]  \\nA skilled batter can use a wide array of \"shots\" or \"strokes\" in both defensive and attacking mode. The idea is to hit the ball to the best effect with the flat surface of the bat\\'s blade. If the ball touches the side of the bat, it is called an \" \". The batter does not have to play a shot and can allow the ball to go through to the . Equally, the batter does not have to attempt a run when hitting the ball with their bat. Batters do not always seek to hit the ball as hard as possible, and a good player can score runs by simply making a deft stroke with a turn of the wrists, or by simply \"blocking\" the ball but directing it away from fielders so that the player has time to take a run. A wide variety of shots are played, the batter\\'s repertoire including strokes named according to the style of swing and the direction aimed: e.g., \" \", \"drive\", \"hook\", and \"pull\".  \\nedge  \\nwicket-keeper  \\ncut  \\n99  \\n[  \\n]  \\nis the only player to have scored one hundred international .  \\nSachin Tendulkar  \\ncenturies  \\nThe batter on strike (i.e., the \"striker\") must prevent the ball from hitting the wicket and try to score by hitting the ball with their bat so that the batter and their partner have time to switch places, with each of them running from one end of the pitch to the other before the fielding side can return the ball and attempt a (throwing the ball at one of the wickets before the run is scored.) To register a run, both runners must touch the behind the popping crease with either their bats or their bodies (the batters carry their bats as they run) before a fielder can throw the ball at the nearby wicket. Each completed run increments the score of both the team and the striker.  \\nruns  \\nrun out  \\nground  \\n100  \\n[  \\n]  \\nThe decision to attempt a run is ideally made by the batter who has the better view of the ball\\'s progress, and this is communicated by calling, usually \"yes\", \"no\" or \"wait\". More than one run can be scored from a single hit. Hits worth one to three runs are common, but the size of the field is such that it is usually difficult to run four or more. To compensate for this, hits that of the field are automatically awarded four runs if the ball touches the ground to the boundary or six runs if the ball clears the boundary without touching the ground within the boundary. In these cases the batters do not need to run. Hits for five are unusual and generally rely on the help of \"overthrows\" by a fielder returning the ball.  \\n100  \\n[  \\n]  \\nreach the boundary  \\nen route  \\n101  \\n[  \\n]  \\nBatters attempting a run while a fielder awaits a throw.  \\nIf an odd number of runs is scored by the striker, the two batters have changed ends, and the one who was non-striker is now the striker. Only the striker can score individual runs, but all runs are added to the team\\'s total.  \\n100  \\n[  \\n]  \\nAdditional runs can be gained by the batting team as (called \"sundries\" in Australia) due to errors made by the fielding side. This is achieved in four ways: , a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if they break the rules (often by failing to bowl the ball before their front foot passes the popping crease at their end); , a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if they bowl so that the ball is out of the batter\\'s reach; , an extra awarded if the batter misses the ball and it goes past the wicket-keeper and gives the batters time to run in the conventional way; and , as for a bye except that the ball has hit the batter\\'s body, though not their bat. If the bowler has bowled an illegal delivery (i.e., a no-ball or a wide), the bowler\\'s team incurs an additional penalty because that ball (i.e., delivery) has to be bowled again, and hence the batting side has the opportunity to score more runs from this extra ball. In addition, the ways in which the batters can be dismissed on an illegal delivery greatly narrow down; in the case of a no-ball, which is the more egregious type of illegal delivery, the only common way in which the batters can be dismissed is by being run out.  \\nextras  \\nno-ball  \\n102  \\n[  \\n]  \\nwide  \\n103  \\n[  \\n]  \\nbye  \\n104  \\n[  \\n]  \\nleg bye  \\n104  \\n[  \\n]  \\n102  \\n[  \\n]  \\n103  \\n[  \\n]  \\nDismissals  \\nMain article:  \\nDismissal (cricket)  \\nMost common dismissals involve the wickets, such as when the ball is bowled at the striker\\'s wicket.  \\nThere are nine ways in which a batter can be dismissed: five relatively common and four extremely rare. When a batter is dismissed, they are said to have \\'lost their wicket\\', and are barred from batting again in that inning; their team is also said to have \\'lost a wicket\\'. Once a team has lost 10 wickets, its innings is over. The common forms of dismissal are (when the striker fails to prevent a delivery from hitting their wicket), (when a ball struck by the bat is caught by a fielder before it hits the ground), (lbw - when the striker\\'s body \\'unfairly\\' prevents a delivery from hitting the wicket), (generally when the ball is thrown at a wicket by a fielder while the batters are running between the wickets), and (a special type of run out - involves the wicket keeper hitting the wicket with the ball). Rare methods are (a striker hitting their own wicket), , , and (a batter failing to enter the field in a timely manner). The Laws state that the fielding team, usually the bowler in practice, must appeal for a dismissal before the umpire can give their decision. If the batter is out, the umpire raises a forefinger and says \"Out!\"; otherwise, the umpire will shake their head and say \"Not out\". There is, effectively, a tenth method of dismissal, (self-dismissal - generally permanent except in cases of injury), which is not an on-field dismissal as such but rather a retrospective one for which no fielder is credited.  \\nbowled  \\n105  \\n[  \\n]  \\ncaught  \\n106  \\n[  \\n]  \\nleg before wicket  \\n107  \\n[  \\n]  \\nrun out  \\n108  \\n[  \\n]  \\nstumped  \\n109  \\n[  \\n]  \\nhit wicket  \\n110  \\n[  \\n]  \\nhit the ball twice  \\n111  \\n[  \\n]  \\nobstructing the field  \\n112  \\n[  \\n]  \\ntimed out  \\n113  \\n[  \\n]  \\n114  \\n[  \\n]  \\nretired out  \\n115  \\n[  \\n]  \\nBowling  \\nMain article:  \\nBowling (cricket)  \\nBowlers generate momentum by running, and then release the ball upon reaching their \"delivery stride\".  \\nPart of on  \\na series  \\nBowling techniques  \\nFast bowling  \\nTechniques:  \\nSeam  \\nSwing  \\nDeliveries:  \\nBouncer  \\nInswinger  \\nKnuckle ball  \\nLeg cutter  \\nOff cutter  \\nOutswinger  \\nReverse swing  \\nSlower ball  \\nYorker  \\nSpin bowling  \\nTechniques:  \\nFinger  \\noff spin  \\nleft-arm orthodox  \\nWrist  \\nleg spin  \\nleft-arm unorthodox  \\nDeliveries:  \\nArm ball  \\nCarrom ball  \\nDoosra  \\nFlipper  \\nGoogly  \\nLeg break  \\nOff break  \\nSlider  \\nTeesra  \\nTopspinner  \\nv  \\nt  \\ne  \\nMost bowlers are considered specialists in that they are selected for the team because of their skill as a bowler, although some are all-rounders, and even specialist batters bowl occasionally. These specialists bowl \"spells\" that are generally 4 to 8 overs long in order not to physically exhaust the bowler, cause muscle strain and stress the skeleton. The rules prevent a single bowler from bowling consecutive overs, resulting in at least two bowlers alternating each over. If the captain wants a bowler to \"change ends\", another bowler must temporarily fill in so that the change is not immediate. The action of bowling the ball is akin to throwing, with the caveat that a bowler\\'s elbow extension is almost entirely restricted, resulting in most bowlers maintaining a straight arm when releasing the ball during their delivery stride. Additionally, while the bowler is not required to pitch (bounce) the ball, a full toss (non-bouncing) delivery that reaches the striker above waist height is penalised as a .  \\n95  \\n[  \\n]  \\nno-ball  \\nA bowler reaches their delivery stride by means of a \"run-up\", and an over is deemed to have begun when the bowler starts their run-up for the first delivery of that over, the ball then being \"in play\". Fast bowlers, or pacemen, need momentum, taking a lengthy run up, while bowlers with a slow delivery take no more than a couple of steps before bowling. The fastest bowlers can deliver the ball at a speed of over 145 kilometres per hour (90\\xa0mph), and they sometimes rely on sheer speed to try to defeat the batter, who is forced to react very quickly. Other fast bowlers rely on a mixture of speed and guile by making the ball or (i.e., curve) in flight. This type of delivery can deceive a batter into miscuing their shot, for example, so that the ball just touches the edge of the bat and can then be \"caught behind\" by the wicket-keeper or a slip fielder. At the other end of the bowling scale is the , who bowls at a relatively slow pace and relies entirely on guile to deceive the batter. A spinner will often \"buy their wicket\" by \"tossing one up\" (in a slower, steeper path) to lure the batter into making a poor shot. The batter has to be very wary of such deliveries, as the batter is often \"flighted\" or spun so that the ball will not behave quite as the batter expects it to, and the batter could be \"trapped\" into getting themself out. Accidental full toss deliveries can also get wickets, as the failure of the ball to bounce can surprise a batsman or induce a poor stroke in an effort to punish the poor delivery with a boundary hit. In between the pacemen and the spinners are the medium-paced seamers, who rely on persistent accuracy to try to contain the rate of scoring and wear down the batter\\'s concentration.  \\n95  \\n[  \\n]  \\n116  \\n[  \\n]  \\nseam  \\nswing  \\n116  \\n[  \\n]  \\nspin bowler  \\nparabolic  \\n117  \\n[  \\n]  \\n116  \\n[  \\n]  \\nSpecialist roles  \\nMain articles: and  \\nCaptain (cricket)  \\nWicket-keeper  \\nThe captain is often the most experienced player in the team, certainly the most tactically astute, and can possess any of the main skillsets as a batter, a bowler or a wicket-keeper.

If the team that bats last scores enough runs to win, it is said to have \"won by wickets\", where is the number of wickets left to fall (batters yet to be dismissed) until the team would have been all out. For example, a team that passes its opponents\\' total having lost six wickets (i.e., six of their batters have been dismissed) wins the match \"by four wickets\", since the team would only have been prevented from scoring the winning runs if four more of its batters had been dismissed, which would have resulted in all but one of its eleven batters being dismissed.  \\nn  \\nn  \\nn  \\nn  \\n85  \\n[  \\n]  \\nIn a two-innings-a-side match, one team\\'s combined first and second innings total may be less than the other side\\'s first innings total.

If the team batting last is all out and both sides have scored the same number of runs, then the match is a ; this result is quite rare in matches of two innings a side with only 62 happening in from the earliest known instance in 1741 until January 2017.

In some cases, ties are broken by having each team bat for a one-over innings known as a ; subsequent Super Overs may be played if the first Super Over ends in a tie. If this kind of match is temporarily interrupted by bad weather, then a complex mathematical formula, known as the after its developers, is often used to recalculate a new target score. A one-day match can also be declared a \"no-result\" if fewer than a previously agreed number of overs have been bowled by either team, in circumstances that make normal resumption of play impossible, for example, wet weather.  \\nlimited overs  \\nSuper Over  \\nDuckworth–Lewis–Stern method  \\n85  \\n[  \\n]  \\nIn all forms of cricket, the umpires can abandon the match if bad light or rain makes it impossible to continue.

Depending on the type of match being played, each team has either one or two innings.
